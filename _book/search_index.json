On their own, they likely won’t form a sufficient introduction to R. In the following, I will draw on the following resources: The great introduction materials developed at the University of Glasgow: https://psyteachr.github.io/, in particular ‘Data Skills for Reproducible Science’. Primers on a variety of topics: https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers Cheat sheets on a variety of topics: https://rstudio.cloud/learn/cheat-sheets 1.2 Installing and Setting up RStudio Currently, the most convenient interface to R is the RStudio GUI. You can either install it locally, or use it online on RStudio Cloud. 1.2.1 Local RStudio installation Typically, RStudio is run on a local computer. Please download R and RStudio separately from: R: https://cran.r-project.org/ R studio: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ (download ‘RStudio Desktop’) 1.2.2 RStudio Cloud You can use the RStudio cloud service for free after getting an account on RStudio Cloud. 1.3 Basics of the RStudio environment Please take a look at the following thorough introduction to the RStudio environment. Please watch the following video by Lisa DeBruine: ‘RStudio Setup’ 1.4 Special blocks in the following In the following, R code blocks will appear as follows. The first block shows the R code, the second block the second block (with text in bold), the R output. mtcars[1:5, &quot;mpg&quot;] ## [1] 21.0 21.0 22.8 21.4 18.7 Grey boxes of this type introduce new functions (at least sometimes). mean(x) Computes the average of a vector of numbers. x The vector to average over. 1.5 Lecture Notes Source Code You can always download the most up-to-date version of these lecture notes from github at this URL: https://github.com/plogacev/ling411_lecture_notes_R "]]
