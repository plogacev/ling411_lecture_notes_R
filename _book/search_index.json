Create a synthetic data set and load the ggplot2 package to access the plotting functionality. library(ggplot2) df &lt;- data.frame(a=1:10, a_sq=(1:10)^2, my_group = c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;)) df ## a a_sq my_group ## 1 1 1 a ## 2 2 4 b ## 3 3 9 a ## 4 4 16 b ## 5 5 25 a ## 6 6 36 b ## 7 7 49 a ## 8 8 64 b ## 9 9 81 a ## 10 10 100 b ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = a, y = a_sq)) + geom_point() ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = a, y = a_sq)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = a_sq, y = a)) + geom_point() ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = a_sq, y = a)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) 5.2 The basics of ggplot2 So what do those function calls mean? Let’s take a look at it again: This is pretty much the minimal useful plotting command in R. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = a, y = a_sq)) + geom_point() Each ggplot2 plot specification consists, at a minimum, of three parts: the data to plot an abstract specification of the plot (a rough mapping between variables and axes and other plot elements, such as groups, facets, etc.) concrete instructions on what to draw (a specification of the actual visual elements to use) They correspond to three parts of the ggplot() function call data: data = df ‘aesthetic’: mapping = aes(x, y) ‘geoms’: + geom_point() You can read the instruction below as “Create a plot using the data in data frame df, placing a on the x-axis and a_sq on the y-axis, and visualize the data using points”. ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = a, y = a_sq)) + geom_point() As an aside: A shorter way to write the same code is below, and I’ll mostly use some mixed form. ggplot(df, aes(a, a_sq)) + geom_point() 5.3 Using lines in plots We already know geom_point and geom_bar. Let’s take a look at some other geoms:. geom_line connects the (invisible, in this case) points in the plot. ggplot(df, aes(a, a_sq)) + geom_line() - We can even combine geoms: ggplot(df, aes(a, a_sq)) + geom_point() + geom_line() - … in fact, as many as we want. But there is no guarantee that the result will look good, or even make sense. ggplot(df, aes(a, a_sq)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) - The order of their specification matter a little bit. Here, the line is plotted over the bars, in contrast to the previous plot. ggplot(df, aes(a, a_sq)) + geom_point() + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) + geom_line() ## Color and fill - Relationships between two variables are usually easy to visualize, but often there is a third variable. - There are various ways for dealing with it. ggplot(df, aes(a, a_sq, color = my_group)) + geom_point(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) - Let’s try this with bar plots. Not at all what you expected, is it? ggplot(df, aes(a, a_sq, color = my_group)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) - This is what we wanted. The right argument for bar plots is fill. ggplot(df, aes(a, a_sq, fill = my_group)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) So why isn’t the aesthetic argument for bar plots not also color? Because geoms in ggplot2 have fill (the color of the inner part of the object), and a color (the color of the line with which they are drawn). Points don’t have a fill. (Don’t ask me why.) ggplot(df, aes(a, a_sq, color = my_group)) + geom_point(size=10, fill = &quot;black&quot;) - Bars have both. ggplot(df, aes(a, a_sq, fill = my_group)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) ggplot(df, aes(a, a_sq, color = my_group)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, fill = &quot;black&quot;) 5.4 Grouping and facets Color, fill, etc. implicitly group the data set into different subgroups. You can see that better if you connect the points by lines. ggplot(df, aes(a, a_sq, color = my_group)) + geom_point() + geom_line() This can be done explicitly as well. ggplot(df, aes(a, a_sq, group = my_group)) + geom_point() + geom_line() Now it’s very hard to see which line is which, so let’s at least separate it into different facets (aka ‘panels’). ggplot(df, aes(a, a_sq, group = my_group)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~my_group) "]]
